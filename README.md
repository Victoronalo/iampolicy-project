Project Objectives:

Centralize user authentication and authorization processes.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to streamline access management.
Enhance security by enforcing least privilege access principles.
Improve user experience through single sign-on (SSO) functionality.
Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements related to data access and protection.

Project Scope: The IAM project will cover the following areas:
1.	User provisioning and de-provisioning.
2.	Role management and access permissions.
3.	Authentication methods and protocols.
4.	Single sign-on (SSO) integration.
5.	Audit logging and reporting.
6.	Integration with existing systems and applications.
7.	Training and documentation for administrators and end-users.



Project Deliverables:

IAM System Architecture Design Document
User Provisioning and De-provisioning Workflows
Role Definitions and Access Control Policies
SSO Integration Guide
Audit Logging and Reporting Mechanisms
User Training Materials
Administrator Documentation



Risk Management:

Lack of stakeholder buy-in
Integration challenges with legacy systems
Data privacy and compliance issues
Insufficient resources or expertise



Conclusion:
The successful implementation of the IAM project will significantly enhance our organization's security posture, streamline access management processes, and improve user experience. By centralizing identity and access controls, we will mitigate security risks and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
